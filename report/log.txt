Chris -- 2 Hours on 3/11
 - Implemented base hierarchical clustering algorithm

Jack -- 1.5 Hours on 3/11
 - Implemented Euclidean Distance with Single Link Method
 - Spent a while wondering why Priority Queue wasn't working right ... but it was, I just misunderstood how add/poll worked

Jack -- 0.5 hours on 3/12
 - Refactored Distance/Linking Methods into their own separate interfaces
    - Linking Method takes in a Point Distance Algorithm as part of its constructor

Chris -- 0.5 hours on 3/14
 - Implemented Centroid Linking method

 Chris -- 0.5 hours on 3/16
 - Added point classification for entropy and purity checking
 
 Saanvi -- 2 hours on 3/18
 - Implemented dendrograms for combinations of euclidean and mahattan distance, and single and centroid linkage 
  - Added slides to presentation 
   - A lot of time was spent understanding how to read a dendrogram
