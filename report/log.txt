All -- 0.5 hours on 3/9
 - Discussed plan for project, identified dataset to test and assigned tasks

Chris -- 2 Hours on 3/11
 - Implemented base hierarchical clustering algorithm

Jack -- 1.5 Hours on 3/11
 - Implemented Euclidean Distance with Single Link Method
 - Spent a while wondering why Priority Queue wasn't working right ... but it was, I just misunderstood how add/poll worked

Jack -- 0.5 hours on 3/12
 - Refactored Distance/Linking Methods into their own separate interfaces
    - Linking Method takes in a Point Distance Algorithm as part of its constructor

Chris -- 0.5 hours on 3/14
 - Implemented Centroid Linking method

Ben -- 0.5 hours on 3/15
 - Implemented Complete Link and Average Link Methods

Chris -- 0.5 hours on 3/16
 - Added point classification for entropy and purity checking

Ben -- 1.5 hours on 3/16
 - Refactored main project to abstract the data processing and clustering to any linking methods
 - Implemented tree printing functionality so we could analyze output and compare linking/distance methods

Jack -- 0.5 hours on 3/16
 - Worked on entropy function & implemented manhattan distance
 
Saanvi -- 2.5 hours on 3/18
 - Implemented dendrograms for combinations of euclidean and mahattan distance, and single, average, complete, and centroid linkage in R
  - Added slides to presentation 
   - Plotted gap statistic and silhouette method in R
     - A lot of time was spent understanding dendrograms and gap statistic and silhouette method

Ben -- 0.5 hours on 3/22
 - Wrote outline for report, updated README

All -- 1.5 hours on 3/22
 - Prepared for presentation, finished slides, edited report and polished code
